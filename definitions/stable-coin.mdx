**Stable coin:** A coin that is pegged to a fiat currency. 
There are two main types of stable coins: collateral backed and algorithmic. 
*Collateral* backed stable coins provide price stability from having a one-to-one backing with fiat (dollar) per coin.
*Algorithmic* stable coins provide price stability by using specialized algorithms and smart contracts to manage the supply of tokens in circulation.
