**Why did we build our [DCA Investor tool](/investor)?** 

Last year we did not [DCA](/definitions#dca) buy as well as we should have. Also we did not set any upper limits on our investments.
We purchased some coins near their peak, and where are we now? (In a Flo Rida voice) Cryptos got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low. 
But hey, did we really lose anything? We haven't sold! But guess what? We can do better.
So in order to get better we thought to ourselves, that it would be nice to set some rules for our investing. No more [FOMO](/definitions#fomo), 
no more buying during the pump. We should set some rules for investing.

## Our investment rules

We do this each month, because consistency is the key to anything.

1. After paying bills, determine how much cash we have left over for investing
1. Determine which coins we are going to buy, we have a limit of 5 or so
2. Set a percentage of the investment allocated to each coin. Example: $BTC should get 30% of our investment
3. Next, if $BTC's price is over a certain amount. It would be smart to buy an alternate. For us this would be a stable coin
4. Do this for each coin we in our list

No feelings, no emotions, purely rational with rules.

## Investment with rules example

Investment amount: $200 USD

|Coin | Percentage | Max Price  | Alternate |
|:----|-----------:|-----------:|:----------|
|BTC  | 40         | 65000      | DAI       |
|ETH  | 30         | 4500       | DAI       |
|ADA  | 15         | 3.50       | DAI       |
|SOL  | 15         | 100        | DAI       |

## Rules applied to data

Now it's the 6th of the month and it's time to invest. We have $200 USD to invest, so let's run through our rules engine.
We start with our first coin in the list, and look up its price using [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/). 
If the value is below our __max price__ then we will buying it this month. Let's say that both $ADA and $SOL are above our max price.
Our rules engine would then suggest buy the __alternate__ listed instead. And our table would look like this:

|Coin | Amount |
|:----|-------:|
|BTC  |$80 USD |
|ETH  |$60 USD |
|DAI  |$60 USD |

The alternate can be any coin you like. Our strategy this year is to buy a [stable coin](/definitions#stable-coin) when the 
prices of assets we wish to own are above our max. Why would we do this? When prices rise, eventually there will be a correction. 
When this happens it's good to have some cash on hand to invest when the market drops. There's nothing worse than not being liquid enough 
when that happens.
